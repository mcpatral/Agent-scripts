List of packages:
- wget

- gcc
- make
- python3
- epel-release

B- Installing jenkins is all manual efforts please use the document in confluence on 
how to install jenkins and see how you can automate it.

C- On the docker main page, there are steps to install docker
on centos7 please write a script to automate the installation
of docker.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/

E- the script on package install is failing in ubuntu and alpine flavors please modify the 
 script in project A to make it a little more dynamic.
